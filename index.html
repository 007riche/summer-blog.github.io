    Confusion matrix in evaluation of intrusion detection systems
        </h1>
<p>Cybercrimes are these crimes that are committed using computers and include mainly online financial fraud crimes, cyberterrorism, computer as a tool, computer as a target types of crimes that consist of phishing scams, identity theft, etc... 
    These crimes may harm peopleâ€™s security and even their financial health. Through the last decade, the number of this type of crime increased rapidly that conversely has led to development of some mitigation tools such as intrusion detection systems used to analyze network traffic in real time in order to detect malicious intention and take some actions. 
    This article is an overview of confusion matrix in intrusion detection systems. </p>
    
<h2>What is confusion matrix?</h2>
<p>A confusion matrix is a type of table construct that plays a specific role in machine learning and related engineering. 
    It helps to show the prediction and recall in a system where the values of the test data are known. 
    The confusion matrix usually treats binary classification type of problems where the number of possible values of the results is two.
In binary classification type of problems such intrusion detection, the confusion matrix is a technique that helps to summarize the performance of classification of
    the model of the machine learning algorithm, classification which is based on a set of data where the final outcome is already known from a historical record.</p>
